    In the paragraph, if you see an "and" linking 2 nouns with 1 adjective in front, help me to pair an adjective for each noun and extract 2 pair of keywords, for example, "simple shapes and colors" should be extracted as "simple shapes" and "simple colors".
    "colorful tiles and patterns" should be extracted as "colorful tiles" and "colorful patterns".
    If verb and noun together, you should keep is as a whole,
    for example, "moving and jumping on the screen" should be 1 keyword, "moving and jumping on the screen".
